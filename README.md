# Stock Market AI
 Stock Market AI is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model designed with TensorFlow. The model can be used to predict future stock prices.
 
 ***There is no correlation between the earnings of companies and their stock prices. The market does not accurately describe the state of the economy nor is governed by any equation. In other words, do not expect any AI to accurately predict the direction of the market.***
